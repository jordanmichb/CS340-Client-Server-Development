Starting state of dashboard: 

Shows each animal of the database on the chart, with the first animal as the default view for the geolocation map. The pie chart will initially show every breed which makes it difficult to read, so it is best to double-click on a breed to isolate it and then single-click on other breeds to add them to the chart. Clicking the Grazioso Salvare logo will open the SNHU homepage.
